# gopro-organizer
A simple tool for automatically organizing chaptered gopro footage

**Make sure the .bat file is in the same drive as (ALL OF) the directory(s) being organized
1. Simply paste in the full directory(s) of the folder containing the videos that need to be organized.
("D:\stuff\Videos\GoPro\2023-03-25\HERO8 BLACK 3", not "D:\stuff\Videos\GoPro\2023-03-25" or "D:\stuff\Videos\GoPro")
2. If entering multiple directories, separate each with a comma, and JUST A COMMA (NO SPACES).
3. Spaces and hyphens in directories are fine, not sure about other special characters.
